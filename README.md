# PermafrostEstimation
Permafrost estimation model in Upper Indus Basin:
- Remotely sensed topo-climatic factors and machine learning techniques were used for mapping the spatial distribution of permafrost in the Tso Kar, a sub-basin of Upper Indus Basin (UIB) in Leh, Ladakh (UT). 
- This schematic model can be applied in the regions where the in-situ data is not available. Several feature selection techniques were employed to identify which remotely sensed parameters were most crucial in defining the permafrost extent over the study region. 
- It was followed by the application and tuning of several machine learning models to deliver an expected accuracy in terms of permafrost classes demarcated over the study region based on literature. 
- The results show that the potential incoming solar radiation (PISR), land surface temperature (LST) and topographic wetness index (TWI) are the most significant remotely sensed parameters affecting the permafrost and associated processes. 
- Above 5000 m a.s.l., the proportion of permafrost in the study catchment is higher. Synergistic use of remote sensing image processing and machine learning together provides unprecedented opportunities for the mapping of permafrost.
